### Settings
- Disable Frame Rate Limit *
- Accelerated Canvas *
	- Only disable this if you have problems or performance issues with your GPU.
- ANGLE Graphics Backend * (W)
	- Using "D3D9" may help with window capture.
	- Performance of the client can be affected by this option.
	- If you are experiencing problems like crashes, try using a different backend.
- Color Profile *
- In-Process GPU *
	- Enabling this may help with window capture.
- Chromium Flags *
	- This setting could overwrite existing flags/settings such as `force-color-profile` (Color Profile setting).
- Discord Rich Presence *

	- Setting this to "Download" is highly recommended since you won't have to worry about manually updating the client but other options are here in case you don't wish the automatic updates.
- Resource Swapper Mode *
- Resource Swapper Path
	- Defaults to `<documents>/idkr/swap`
- Enable Userscripts *
	- Only use truly trusted scripts, they are more dangerous than web extensions. It can cause serious damage if used wrongly.

## Running/Building From The Source Code
Pre-built releases are cool but you may want to use the latest features/bugfixes.
This is a simple tutorial to get the source code, install dependencies, and run or build the client.  

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (Optional for easier clone/pull operations)

### Downloading The Source Code
If you use git (recommended):
```sh
# If it's your first time getting the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Mixaz017/idkr.git

# ...or if you use GitHub CLI instead
gh repo clone Mixaz017/idkr -- --depth 1

# If you already cloned the repository and want to update to the latest commit
git pull
```
If you don't use git, [Download ZIP](https://github.com/Mixaz017/idkr/archive/master.zip) and extract. You have to do this every time you want to update the client, so I recommend using git instead.

### Run Or Build the Client
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# If you want to run the client without building it
npm start

# If you want to build the client
npm run dist
```
After building the client, a new directory named `dist` containing executable binary files (`.exe`, `.dmg`, or `.AppImage`) will be created (existing files will be overwritten).
